            <p>
                The Master of Information Technology at The University of Melbourne was a natural
                choice for its:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ease of entry:</strong> The only prerequisites were my single coding subject and a Bachelor
                    degree.</li>
                <li><strong>Breadth of specialisations:</strong> I wasn’t certain on the area I would like to focus on.
                    Artificial intelligence was the trend, but cyber security was the security—yet all I wanted was to
                    write software.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                My initial choice of specialisation was the vanilla Computing. However, due to the lack of interesting
                electives, I eventually relocated to Artificial Intelligence. Both share more similarities than differences in
                terms of their course structure.

            <h2><a href="school/b-com.html">Bachelor of Commerce</a></h2>
            <h3>The University of Melbourne</h3>
            <p><strong>Feb 2021 - Dec 2023</strong></p>

            <p>
                I chose Commerce because I performed well in Commerce subjects during high school. I didn't have a strong passion for anything at the time. The University of Melbourne provided me with the most generous scholarship, and was the highest ranked university in Melbourne.
            </p>

            <p>
                I majored in <strong>Accounting & Finance</strong>. Accounting promised the best job security. Finance was quite straightforward for a black-and-white person like myself.

            <p><strong>Oct 2016 - Nov 2020</strong></p>

            <p>
                My dad selected McKinnon Seconday College for its high performance as a public non-selective school. It was the correct choice as I was surrounded by thoughtful, motivated and responsible peers.
